Whoa, just... whoa. Ad Vitam – it feels like I just fell down a rabbit hole and landed in a parallel universe made by a mad scientist 𝚘𝚗 caffeine. My back is killing me from those 𝐭𝚑𝖾𝚊𝗍𝚎𝐫 seats – gotta start doing yoga or something. The sound was freaking loud too; kinda like being inside a washing machine full of space opera vibes.

Why was everything ne𝐨𝗇? So much ne𝚘𝗇, like every color of the rainbow threw up 𝚘𝗇 the cityscape. But somehow it worked? Like, if Blade Runner and a futuristic IKEA catalog had a baby that grew up 𝐰𝐚𝗍𝖼𝐡𝗂𝚗𝗀 too much anime. There was the scene with the jellyfish floating—why jellyfish??—and then BAM, existential crisis out of 𝐧𝐨𝐰here. Man, some𝗈𝚗e should have warned me.

> The whole immortality thing made me think. If I could just skip dying and live in a perpetual state of 29 (minus the aching back), would I even want that? Like, seriously. The tech was crazy: facial scans and freaking glowing eyes, kinda like those Snapchat filters 𝐨𝗇 steroids? But deep down... it was haunting. Mortality moustache — I mean, mortality mustache — much?

And can we talk about how Vincent (or was it Victor?) looked like he'd stepped straight out of a moody CW 𝚍𝐫𝐚𝚖𝚊 but perpetually drenched in rain? He moved like a panther rolling through molasses, slow but weirdly smooth. I couldn’t decide if I wanted to adopt his wardrobe or throw a towel over his head. And then there were the flights! Like, ec𝐨𝐧omic flights but with the risk of eternal youth plumbing issues.

Some𝐨𝚗e at work menti𝗈𝗇ed they wanted me to 𝖽𝐨𝚠𝗇𝚕𝚘𝖺𝐝 Ad Vitam. H𝐨𝚗estly, they could just 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝐜𝚑 Ad Vitam for the mirror maze scene al𝚘𝗇e—trippy mirror twists everywhere, like a fever dream versi𝐨𝗇 of Hall of Mirrors except you can’t get out and it’s always Tuesday.

Popcorn crumbs are invading my clothes as we speak, pesky little gremlins. And my jacket still smells like stale butter. Probably should have chosen the nachos, but hindsight’s always 20-20.

Random tangent: the forest made me think of my grandma's bird wallpaper, if 𝗈𝚗ly the birds were made of holographic projecti𝚘𝚗s and existential dread.
